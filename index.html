			<h3>Manual</h3>
			<div class="scrolling-text">
				Morning Commute is a two-player game where each player controls one train.<br/><br/>
				Hold down your key (P or Q) to reduce your speed. If your speed is reduced when you reach a junction,
				you will turn; otherwise you will continue going straight.<br/><br/>
				Moving past a station will drop off and pick up passengers from that station. Each passenger has a
				destination station. The destinations of your passengers can be seen at the bottom of the screen, with
				the first station representing the highest demand.<br/><br/>
				Trains have a limited capacity. If your train is full, you will need to drop off passengers before
				picking up any more.<br/><br/>
				At 10:00 AM, the morning commute is over and the player who has delivered more passengers wins. If the
				trains collide, neither player wins.<br/><br/>
				Bonus single player mode! Type 'PQPPQ' on the title screen to enable single-player mode, where the blue train (P) is replaced
				by a cold, calculating AI that doesn't understand things like mercy or strategy.

			<h3>Design Levels</h3>

				You can create your own levels!<br/><br/>
				Levels in Morning Commute were created using <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/" target="_blank">Tiled</a>.
				Using the <a href="src/tiled/map1.tmx" target="_blank">stage 1 map template</a> and the <a href="img/ul.png" target="_blank">map tile image</a>, 
				create your own maps, export them as JSON, and paste the text of the resulting file into the text field below.
				Then, select "Load From External..." from the level selection menu.<br/><br/>
				Alternatively, just download this whole game, add some JSON files, and modify maps.json. This gives more
				flexibility and lets you create your own collections of levels.<br/><br/>
				Notes:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>All objects must be in the proper layer.</li>
					<li>Tracks must form complete circuits; dead ends may have unexpected results.</li>
					<li>Stations must be facing adjacent tracks.</li>
					<li>Train locations are marked by placing train heads in the 'Trains' layer.</li>
					<li>Trains must start on straight sections of track.</li>
					<li>Props should not overlap tracks.</li>
				</ul>
